# stratagem

λ-calculus interpretation with support for user-defined distfix syntax!

Stratagem is meant to be an educational tool for learning the simple λ-calculus quickly and permanently. Students should use the tool to develop their own small languages by encoding relevant constructs and binding them to syntax that they design. Given such a set of bindings, the tool will generate a parser and provide an interpreter that can be used to execute programs written in the resulting language.
