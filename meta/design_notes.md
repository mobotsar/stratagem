First thing's first -- take a precedence grammar, give it to aasam, get a cfg, give it to a parsert generator, get a parser, call it the parser.
Take a source file, give it to the parser, get an ast, rewrite it, get a simple lambda tree, give it to a lambda calculus interpreter, get a result, display it.
